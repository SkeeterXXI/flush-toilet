# flush
Servo controlled flush with PIR sensor on ESP8266 NodeMCU

Completed in HomeAssistant using ESPHome

Including automation for notification to my mobile after 5 seconds of movement detected.

This is so I can flush the toilet remotely for my cat who is trained to use the toilet.

He likes a clean toilet, and when I am away I needed a method of flushing the toilet for him.

Photos coming later....
